This project is an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript application that utilizes Poisson disc sampling to generate points and applies Delaunay triangulation to convert those points into triangles for the background. Additionally, it fetches random quotes from a JSON file named "quotes.json" and displays them on the website. The quotes used in this project are sourced from the book titled "The Book of Answers."
